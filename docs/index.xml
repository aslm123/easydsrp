    <description>Using R and Python to tackle Data Science Problems one at a time. R and Python
are the titans of Data Science. The Statistical Computing environement provided
by R and the general purpose nature coupled with easily readable syntax of Python
make them a formiddable duo. I have been wanting to explore these two languages in the 
data science doomain and this is how I would like to share my knowledge with the world.

      <description>In my last post I conducted EDA on the Pima Indians dataset to get it ready for a suite of Machine Learning techniques. My second post will explore just that. Taking one step at a time, my incoming posts will include one Machine Learning technique showing an indepth (as indepth as I can get) look at how to conduct each technique. Lets start with Decision Trees!</description>

      <title>Diabetes Among The Pima Indians: An Exploratory Analysis</title>

      <description>In this post we will explore the Pima Indian dataset from the UCI repository. This post will aim to showcase different ways of thinking of your 
data. Most novices to data science would rush into data preprocessing and not explore the data properly. The data cleaning stage can be subjective 
at times and here I offer my own view and opinons on this dataset</description>
